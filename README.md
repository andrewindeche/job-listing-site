<p>The ReadME documents details configuring of an angular Project for a Job Listing and Filtering Application</p>

## <h1> Description</h1>
<p>The Aim of the project is to build an Angular application that showcases job listings and allows users to
filter and search for jobs based on various criteria.</p>

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Run Linter

Run`ng lint` to execute linting of the angular application. The dependency can be configured using `ng add` command.
